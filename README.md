# C and C++ Execises
These are all projects I've done in school to learn C.
Since I've been wanting to soon start applying for jobs I thought that displaying that I do not only say I know C but displaying it might be a good idea. ✌️Enjoy

## Metro
This was the assignment:
The London metro is a ring of 27 stations without an end stop. 
You need to simulate a 1h ride of this metro with a specific number of passengers.
The stations are numbered between 0 and 26.
The time that the metro takes from one stop to another is set to 120 seconds. 
The metro stays still in proportion to how many people get on it. We assume people take about 1 second.
The passenger behaviour is described in the file: passeggeri.txt. 
Every line of the file describes the behaviour in 3 parameters:
- stazione di salita;
- istante di arrivo nella stazione (in secondi dopo le 12:00);
- stazione di discesa. 
Simulate the ride within 12pm and 1pm (3,600 seconds) 
reporting the instant of arrival and departure in every station in seconds from 12pm, and the number of passengers
present on the train during every step. In absence of passengers the train departs at istant 0 in the station 0.
